## Introduction
Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machinery is crucial for maintenance planning and avoiding unexpected failures. This project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict RUL based on sensor data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from NASA's Prognostics Data Repository, available on Kaggle. It consists of sensor measurements from machinery over time, including data from various operational conditions.

### Experimental Scenario

This project serves as an experimental exploration into predictive maintenance using machine learning techniques. While the results are promising, it's important to note that this is an experimental setup. Download datasets:

The NASA CMAPSS dataset includes the following key components:

- **Engine ID**: Identifies the specific engine. Typical sensors include Fan Speed, Pressure, Temperature, Flow rates.
- **Cycle**: The time cycle for the recorded measurements.
- **Setting 1, 2, 3**: These are the operational settings that influence the engine's performance.
- **Sensor 1 to Sensor 21**: These columns represent various sensor measurements monitoring different parameters of the engine.

Dataset is divided into four data sets:

Data Set: FD001
Train trjectories: 100
Test trajectories: 100
Conditions: ONE (Sea Level)
Fault Modes: ONE (HPC Degradation)

Data Set: FD002
Train trjectories: 260
Test trajectories: 259
Conditions: SIX 
Fault Modes: ONE (HPC Degradation)

Data Set: FD003
Train trjectories: 100
Test trajectories: 100
Conditions: ONE (Sea Level)
Fault Modes: TWO (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation)

Data Set: FD004
Train trjectories: 248
Test trajectories: 249
Conditions: SIX 
Fault Modes: TWO (HPC Degradation, Fan Degradation)

 Each data set is further divided into training and test subsets. Each time series is from a different engine, the data can be considered to be from a fleet of engines of the same type. Each engine starts with different degrees of initial wear and manufacturing variation which is unknown to the user.


The goal of using this dataset is to leverage these measurements and settings to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the engines accurately.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), which is well-suited for time series prediction tasks. 
To train and evaluate the model, run the following command:

`python RUL_training.py`

## Results

The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (Train Loss), Validation Mean Squared Error (Val Loss) and RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)

After the training process is completed, the algorithm saves the trained model to a file. This allows you to reuse the model for predictions without needing to retrain it each time. The model is saved in a `pth` format. Additionally, it generates graphs of training loss and validation loss over epochs to help visualize the model's learning process. This helps in visualizing the learning process and diagnosing potential issues like overfitting.

To use model, run:

`python pred_model.py`

Visualize Predictions: After running the script, it will generate a plot showing the predicted RUL versus the actual RUL. 

This plot helps in understanding how well the model predicts the Remaining Useful Life.
Here's an example of how the plot might look:

In this plot:

- The x-axis represents the time cycles.
- The y-axis represents the Remaining Useful Life (RUL).

The blue curve represents the actual RUL, while the red curve represents the predicted RUL. This visualization helps assess how well the model predicts the RUL compared to the ground truth.
