## COVID-19
PyTorch-based ML model for detecting COVID-19 based on chest X-ray images.
The model classifies images into three categories: Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and COVID-19.

### Install
- Fetch the data from Kaggle - [COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) dataset
- You will get `archive.zip` in the folder

Run:
```bash
python tools/prepare_datasets.py archive.zip -d data
```

This will create `data` directory with datasets divided in 3 hospitals (`h1`, `h2` and `h3`) plus additionally a `test` dataset, which will be used to test the produced model.


### Train Model
`covid19.py` is a model that needs to be trained.

Do do the training, execute:

```bash
î‚° python covid19.py data/h1 data/h2 data/h3 --model model.pth  
```

### Test Model
Inference can be done using `predict.py`:

```bash
python predict.py --model model.pth --image test/COVID/COVID-3.png
```
